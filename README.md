This project aims at creating an R package for EDA.

The R package will have functions which can be used for recipe creation using pipe operators.

The vignette/handbook will showcase how the API can be used.

While the original Foundation Brick EDA will be a working interface powered by this API at the back.

The main file to be sourced is EDA.R
