#' analysisPipelines
#'
#' This package allows data scientists to compose and generate reports as a set of analytical operations.
#' The sequence of generation can be stored as a pipeline and reused, specifically for production systems where these
#' tasks are run repetitively. Additionally, the package implements a form of lazy evaluation where the pipelines are
#'  run on datasets only when outputs/ reports need to be generated
