#' The package aims at enabling data scientists to compose pipelines of analysis which consist of data manipulation,
#' exploratory analysis & reporting, as well as modeling steps. It also aims to enable data scientists to use tools
#' of their choice through an R interface, and compose interoperable pipelines between R, Spark, and Python.
